# Ex1: Number Conversions and Operations

This repository implements a Java program for performing basic operations on numbers in various bases, including validation, conversion, and arithmetic operations.




## Features

- Number Validation (<number><b><base>):

- Validates strings in the format <number><b><base>, where <number> is a valid value for the given <base> and <base> ranges 
    from 2 to 16.
    Handles both decimal numbers (without b) and numbers with explicit bases.
    Number Conversion:

- Convert a number string to its decimal equivalent (number2Int).
- Convert a decimal number to a string in any base from 2 to 16 (int2Number).
 - Arithmetic Operations:
    Add and multiply two numbers, with results displayed in a user-specified base.
- Comparison:
    Compare two numbers to check for equality in decimal format.
    Find the index of the largest number in an array of <number><b><base> strings.

- Comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness of all implemented functions.
